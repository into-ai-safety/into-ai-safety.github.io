The official website for the Into AI Safety podcast.

### Logistics

- Content will be released every week at 9:00 on Monday mornings (for me, which is Mountain Time - see time conversion chart below for other time zones).
- I will alternate between full length episodes and shorter (approximately 15 minute) minisodes.
- All episodes will be published to all podcast platforms linked on this site, as well as this website.
- You can subscribe to the RSS feed for this website <a href="https://into-ai-safety.github.io/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.

### Additional Information

The album cover image was generated with <a href="https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DreamStudio</a>. Once I have this podcast more established, I plan on contracting an artist to design a more permanent version.

The podcast intro was written and created by Chase Precopia, who also does the audio editing and mastering for the podcast, starting with episode 3.

If you have any suggestions, comments, or concerns, please email me at <intoaisafety@gmail.com>.

I am a Mechanical and Computer Science Engineering professional with a Master’s in Computational Modeling. My ideal career contribution is in a value-based organization with a mission to improve lives through the pursuit and implementation of sustainable policies and practices. 

In my next role, I anticipate designing, developing, and implementing methods, processes, and systems to analyze diverse data. My contribution will include applying my knowledge of statistics, data analysis, optimization, visualization, and data modeling to integrate and clean data, recognize patterns, address uncertainty, pose questions, and make discoveries from structured and/or unstructured data. 

I’m looking forward to collaborating with like colleagues to produce solutions driven by exploratory data analysis from complex and high-dimensional datasets. I am unafraid to experiment and make decisions in a fast-paced environment. Together we will design, develop, and evaluate predictive models and advanced algorithms that lead to optimal value extraction from the data and lead to better business decisions.

I’m looking forward to making a significant contribution to any of the following industries: Renewable Energy, Medical Research, Biotech, Game Designs, MEMS, Engineering and Technology Consulting.

In addition to my professional credentials, I am an avid enjoyer of games of all kinds. Role-playing games, such as Dungeons and Dragons or the LARP (live action role-play) camp that I grew up attending, [Sword Camp](https://swordcamp.com/). In fact, I loved Sword Camp so much that as soon as I could, I began volunteering as an assistant counselor, which eventually turned into my first job as a camp counselor. During my time as a counselor, I also played a large role in designing, writing, play-testing, and finalizing a major update to the camp's LARP system.

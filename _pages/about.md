The official website for the Into AI Safety podcast.

The album cover image was generated with <a href="https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DreamStudio</a>. Once I have this podcast more established, I plan on contracting an artist to design a more permanent version.

If you have any suggestions, comments, or concerns, please email me at <intoaisafety@gmail.com>.

For more information on the host, Jacob Haimes, you can visit my <a href="https://jacob-haimes.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">portfolio</a>.

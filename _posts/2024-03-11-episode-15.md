After getting some advice and reflecting more on my own personal goals, I have decided to shift the direction of the podcast towards accessible content regarding "AI" instead of the show's original focus. I will still be releasing what I am calling research ride-along content to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/IntoAISafety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a>, but the show's feed will consist only of content that I aim to make as accessible as possible.
